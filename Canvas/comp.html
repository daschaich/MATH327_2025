<p>In this computer assignment you will numerically analyse two types of diffusive behaviour in one-dimensional random walks. &nbsp;After warm-up exercises on pseudo-random numbers and inverse transform sampling, analysing ordinary diffusion will allow you to verify your numerical results by comparing them with exact analytic predictions based on the law of large numbers and central limit theorem. &nbsp;You will then adapt these verified numerical methods to consider <em>anomalous diffusion</em>, where exact analytic predictions are not available.</p>
<p>There are five exercises in the assignment, four of which provide relevant background information in addition to the tasks for you to complete. &nbsp;While the exercises mention some syntax specific to Python, you may use a different programming language if you prefer. &nbsp;<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://tinyurl.com/math327demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This demo</a> illustrates all the Python programming tools needed for the assignment. &nbsp;For any reasonable programming language, the numerical computations for each exercise should complete in a few minutes or less.</p>
<p>This assignment is due by <strong>17:00 on Friday, 21 February 2025</strong>. &nbsp;Submit your work by file upload here. &nbsp;<strong>Both</strong> your answers to the questions in the assignment (including plots) <strong>and</strong> the code that produces your results must be submitted. &nbsp;You are free to upload multiple files in various formats, a combined tar/zip archive, or a single document including everything, as you prefer. &nbsp;For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A common approach in past years was to answer the non-computational questions using pen and paper, and then photograph / scan this using either an app like CamScanner or an actual scanner (available <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://libanswers.liverpool.ac.uk/faq/49444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our Library</a>). &nbsp;If you have trouble saving the plots as pdf or png files, you can submit screenshots of them.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, the answers can be typed up into a pdf (which can also include the plots), for instance using MS Word, LibreOffice Writer, or latex.</li>
    <li>It's also possible to put everything (code, plots, and non-computational work) into a single Jupyter (ipynb) notebook. &nbsp;You may have noticed that the demo takes this approach, using latex to format mathematical expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, the code can all be in a single file, or you can use a different file for each task. &nbsp;For whichever method you choose, make sure to include enough intermediate steps for me to be able to follow your logic. &nbsp;The correctness of the submitted code contributes to the marks listed in the assignment. &nbsp;While no marks will be deducted for stylistic reasons, it is in your interest to make your code as readable as possible, to simplify my marking and your debugging</p>
<p>Marking is typically slower for this assignment compared to traditional homework, due to the need to check both the code and the non-computational work. &nbsp;You can help to speed up this process by submitting code in its native format (for example, a <code>.py</code> file for Python code or a <code>.m</code> file for MATLAB code). &nbsp;Use of resources beyond the module materials (for example, asking ChatGPT to help debug your code) must be explicitly referenced in your submissions. &nbsp;Clear and neat presentations of your workings and the logic behind them will contribute to your mark. &nbsp;Anonymous marking is turned on, and I will aim to return feedback by Monday, 10 March 2025.</p>
