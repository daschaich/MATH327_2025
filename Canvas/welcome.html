<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Module overview</strong></span></p>
<p>"<a class="inline_disabled" href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.177.4047.393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Is Different</a>" is the title of a famous 1972 essay that established the concept of emergent phenomena --- the idea that large, complex physical systems generally can't be understood by extrapolating the properties of small, simple systems. &nbsp;For example, consider the ~<img class="equation_image" title="10^{22}" src="https://canvas.liverpool.ac.uk/equation_images/10%255E%257B22%257D?scale=1" alt="LaTeX: 10^{22}" data-equation-content="10^{22}" data-ignore-a11y-check="" /> H<sub>2</sub>O molecules in a cubic centimetre of water. &nbsp;While we can use Newton's laws (or the laws of quantum mechanics) to analyse a few of these molecules, this does not allow us to predict processes such as phase transitions of this water into steam or ice.</p>
<p>Instead, we have to apply the stochastic (probabilistic) techniques of <em>statistical mechanics</em> --- one of the central pillars of modern physics, along with quantum mechanics and relativity. &nbsp;While statistical mechanics was originally developed in the context of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century, it is more generally applicable to any large-scale (macroscopic) behaviour that emerges from the microscopic dynamics of <em>many</em> underlying objects. &nbsp;It is intimately connected to quantum field theory, and has been applied to topics from nuclear physics and cosmology to climate science and biophysics, often with outstanding success (recently recognized by the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2021/popular-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021</a> and <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/popular-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2024</a> Nobel Prizes in Physics, to name just two).</p>
<p>This module covers both foundations and applications of statistical mechanics.&nbsp; Foundational topics include the concepts of statistical ensembles, the laws of thermodynamics, and derived quantities such as entropy.&nbsp; We will apply these foundations to investigate diffusion, the behaviour of idealized physical systems such as classical and quantum gases, thermodynamic cycles, and phase transitions. &nbsp;In particular, we will use numerical computer programming to investigate diffusion in terms of stochastic processes.&nbsp; <strong>No</strong> prior exposure to quantum mechanics or computer programming is required --- all necessary information on these topics will be provided.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Schedule </strong></span></p>
<p>Most weeks we will have lectures at 13:00&ndash;14:00 on Monday and 11:00&ndash;13:00 on Wednesday, with tutorials at 10:00&ndash;11:00 on Thursday, all in Room 210.&nbsp; The tutorials in weeks 2, 3 and 4 (on 6, 13 and 20 February) will be computer lab sessions in Hub 502 PC Teaching Centre B, to provide opportunities for you to work on the computer assignment summarized below.</p>
<p>I will use Panopto to record lectures (and lecturey bits of tutorials and computer labs), and Zoom to provide a way for anyone unable to attend in person to connect remotely through <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://liverpool-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/99270154627?pwd=opN8TdnbW3xELD4gxPGgAdkIbL61uk.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this link</span></a> (meeting ID 992 7015 4627, passcode Math327!).</p>
<p><strong>Office hours</strong> will take place at 14:00 on Mondays and 11:00 on Thursdays, after the corresponding lecture and tutorial.&nbsp; They will be held in Room 123 of the Theoretical Physics Wing, and will also connect to the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://liverpool-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/99270154627?pwd=opN8TdnbW3xELD4gxPGgAdkIbL61uk.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Zoom link</span></a> above.&nbsp; Additional office hours can also be scheduled <a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://calendly.com/daschaich/meet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>by appointment</span></a>, and you can always reach me by email at <a href="mailto:david.schaich@liverpool.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">david.schaich@liverpool.ac.uk</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Assessment</strong></span></p>
<p>There will be three in-term assignments.&nbsp; Each accounts for 15% of the module mark, with the remaining 55% coming from the final exam. &nbsp;<span>While the deadlines listed below are not ideal, they have been centrally coordinated within the Department to minimize pile-up across different modules:</span></p>
